/* 

“Poly” means several and “morphism” means form. 
So we can say that polymorphism is something that has several forms 
or we can say it as one name and multiple forms.



There are two types of polymorphism:
Compile-time polymorphism
Run time polymorphism 


****Compile Time Polymorphism (early binding)
    --> In compile-time polymorphism, it is already known which function will run. 
        which means that you are already bound to the function call and you know that this function is going to run. 
    --> Very efficient

    ** Function Overloading
    1.This is a feature that lets us create more than one function 
    and the functions have the same names but their parameters need to be different. 
    2.If function overloading is done in the program and function calls are made the compiler already knows that which functions to execute.

    ** Operator Overloading
    This is a feature that lets us define operators working for some specific tasks. 


****Run Time Polymorphism (late binding)
    --> In the run-time polymorphism, the compiler doesn’t know already what will happen at run time. 
        The run time polymorphism is considered slow because function calls are decided at run time. 
    --> slows down program execution

   **  Virtual Function
    A function that is in the parent class but redefined in the child class is called a virtual function.
